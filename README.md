# Stinger-Website

Below is a summary of what we did for our project. It was split into three assignments, with a final part added on in the end.

For the first assignment, we created a sample page
of what a blog page looks like. We created posts and
and put in an icon to make the website look more neat.

For the second assignment, we added more pages, connected
them using a navigation bar, and set up a localhost for the 
website.

For the third assignment, we started to revamp the look of the website, brought EJS into making our pages look more dynamic, and reworked our internals to set ourselves up for success.  While there have been some flounders in our setup and lack of certain functionality, we are aiming to bring the website close to where it was promised.

For the final part of the semester project, we attempted to bring everything to a close. Passport.js was not set up due to a lack of direction on how to set it up, as well as a lack of time. However, we were able to close with some functionality, such as the database being linked and the login/signup boxes being able to sign someone up and log them in.
